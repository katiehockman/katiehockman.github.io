  <h1>Katie Hockman</h1>

  <p>
    I'm a software engineer, currently engineering manager, with over 8 years of
    professional experience. I've been a technical leader across a wide set of
    domains, including highly distributed backend systems, open source client libraries,
    and programming language tools. I have a love and a passion for the Go programming
    language, and previously worked on the Go team at Google for 3.5 years.

          Tech Lead for <b>fuzzing</b>, which supports Go developers in finding and

          programming language to provide this functionality in its standard
          toolchain, and promotes the security of the Go ecosystem. When I began
          this work, it was the 3rd most upvoted proposal on the Go issue tracker.

          These are the default services used by all Go developers for secure,
          reliable source code downloads. Go is the first language to support
          downloads in this way, and this work has inspired other languages to
          consider using similar techniques.

          I led a senior engineering team in design, development, product
          planning, and launch. Drove cross-team collaboration with product,
          legal, leadership, and the open source community. I was a primary
          contributor to the checksum database, which ensured consistency of
          Go module fetches across the entire ecosystem. This involved integrating with
          <a href="https://github.com/google/trillian">Trillian</a> (the Merkle tree
          backing the <a href="https://research.swtch.com/tlog">transparency log</a>),

          frontend.

      <li>
        This was a brand new team that we built from the ground up. I worked
        on a 20% basis with a group of other 20%ers for about a year before I
        transitioned to the team full time. During the development of this
        team, I was involved with the hiring of other engineers, as well as a
        Technical Program Manager.
      </li>
      <li>
        Trained engineers/UX, <b>fixed accessibility issues</b>, and facilitated
        systemic change in the organization to make workplace tools accessible
        and usable for employees with disabilities. Worked on tools to track
        accessibility progress across the organization.
      </li>
      <li>
        This team helped me hone my cross-functional leadership skills. As
        part of engaging with other teams at Google, I worked with management,
        engineers, and UX experts across the organization to get their team
        up-to-speed and passionate about accessibility. The goal was to make
        teams self-sustainable and set up for success in the long-term.

        While on this team, I worked 20% with the accessibility team (a
