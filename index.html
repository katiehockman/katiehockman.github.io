      Google, New York - Senior Software Engineer | June 2015 - present
    </span>
    <h3 class="team-name">
      Go Language Team, Go Security Team: August 2018 - present
    </h3>
    <ul class="team-details">
      <li>
        <p>
          Tech Lead for Go fuzzing, which supports Go developers in finding and
          fixing bugs and security exploits in their programs. This is the first
          programming language to provide this functionality in its standard
          toolchain, and promotes the security of the Go ecosystem.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was the lead of this ~2 year effort at all stages of development. I
          authored the
          <a href="golang.org/s/draft-fuzzing-design">API and CLI design</a>,
          and led implementation, product planning, documentation, public
          communications, and launch.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have spoken on two Go Time podcasts about fuzzing, and authored a
          <a href="https://go.dev/blog/fuzz-beta">blog post</a>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Tech Lead for the module mirror, checksum database, and index
          (<a href="https://proxy.golang.org">proxy.golang.org</a>,
          <a href="https://sum.golang.org">sum.golang.org</a>,
          and <a href="https://index.golang.org">index.golang.org</a> respectively).
          These are the default services used by all Go developers for secure,
          reliable source code downloads. Go is the first language to support
          downloads in this way, and this work has inspired other languages to
          consider using similar techniques.
        </p>
        <p>
          This service has an SLO of 5 9s, and I am a member of the oncall team.
        </p>
        <p>
          I led a senior engineering team in design, development, product
          planning, and launch. Drove cross-team collaboration with product,
          legal, leadership, and the open source community. I was the primary
          contributor for the checksum database, which was the most
          security-sensitive part of the project. This involved integrating with
          <a href="https://github.com/google/trillian">Trillian</a> (the Merkle tree
          backing the <a href="https://research.swtch.com/tlog">transparency log</a>),
          and implementing tiling of Trillian's data to store and serve through the
          frontend.
        </p>
        <p>
          I traveled around the world to present about this project, and my
          <a href="https://youtu.be/KqTySYYhPUE">talk</a>
          and <a href="https://go.dev/blog/module-mirror-launch">blog post</a>
          have become the canonical source for Go developers to understand this topic.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Triaged and fixed vulnerabilities in the Go standard library,
        implemented hardening measures and security fixes as a member of the
        Go security team.
      </li>
      <li>Promoted to Senior Software Engineer in 2019.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="team-name">
      Accessibility Internal Tools Team: August 2015 - August 2018
    </h3>
    <ul class="team-details">
      <li>
        This was a brand new team that we built from the ground up. I worked
        on a 20% basis with a group of other 20%ers for about a year before I
        transitioned to the team full time. During the development of this
        team, I was involved with the hiring of other engineers, as well as a
        Technical Program Manager.
      </li>
      <li>
        Trained engineers/UX, fixed accessibility issues, and facilitated
        systemic change in the organization to make workplace tools accessible
        and usable for employees with disabilities. Worked on tools to track
        accessibility progress across the organization.
      </li>
      <li>
        This team helped me hone my cross-functional leadership skills. As
        part of engaging with other teams at Google, I worked with management,
        engineers, and UX experts across the organization to get their team
        up-to-speed and passionate about accessibility. The goal was to make
        teams self-sustainable and set up for success in the long-term.
      </li>
      <li>Promoted to Software Engineer II in 2017.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="team-name">
      Supply Chain APIs Team: June 2015 - August 2016
    </h3>
    <ul class="team-details">
      <li>
        Implemented Java APIs and services to support Google supply chain.
        This work mostly involved writing business logic around external APIs.
        For example, I owned the integration work involved with supporting new
        shipping carriers for return slips of Google orders.
      </li>
      <li>
        I was a member of the oncall team, and I partnered with Site
        Reliability Engineers to onboard them to work with the team.
      </li>
      <li>
        While on this team, I worked 20% with the accessibility team (a
        collaboration with the org's VP) which was an effort that I eventually
        transitioned to full-time in 2016.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="team-name">Miscellanous responsibilities</h3>
    <ul class="team-details">
      <li>
        Mentored several junior engineers during my time at Google, both
        formally and informally.
      </li>
      <li>Hosted two interns, and co-hosted an engineering resident.</li>
      <li>
        Conducted over 50 technical interviews, both over the phone, and
        in-person, and been a part of the hiring decisions for several
        different roles at Google.
      </li>
      <li>Participated in promotion committees.</li>
      <li>Taught several accessibility sessions to new hires.</li>
